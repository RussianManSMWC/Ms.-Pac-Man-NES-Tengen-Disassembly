# Ms. Pac-Man NES Tengen Disassembly
This is a disassembly of Ms. Pac-Man for the NES, specifically the Tengen version from 1990.

Doesn't include graphics data. You must rip the graphics yourself from the ROM.

Assemble the game using "CC65" compiler/assembler.

Special thanks to **Andyana Jonseph** for getting me to do this. Without him, I would have never disassembled this game.
