GRAPHICAL TABLES are stored in these files.
these are used to format sprite tiles for each entity and their animations
Format:
The very first byte of the table determines how many sprite tiles are used
The rest are 4 byte-long entries for each of the tiles
First byte - Y-displacement
Second byte - tile
Third byte - property (palette, X/Y flip, background priority bit)
Fourth byte - X-displacement

example:
.byte 1
.byte -8,$80,OAMProp_Palette3,-8

the very first byte of the table is the amount of sprite tiles used to render this entity. since it's one in this case, it will use one OAM tile

after this, the rest is as explained above:
since first byte is Y-displacement, it'll be displaced by -8 pixels (negative value means displaced upwards, positive - downward)
second byte is sprite tile to display
third byte is property of the tile, in this case the sprite tile will use sprite palette 3
fourth byte is X-displacement, same as Y-displacement but on X-axis.
